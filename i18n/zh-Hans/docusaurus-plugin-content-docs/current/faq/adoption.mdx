# Adoption

```mdx-code-block
import TOCInline from '@theme/TOCInline';
import Construction from '@site/src/components/Construction';

<Construction />
<TOCInline toc={toc} />
```

## What happens if I don't want to work on my plugin anymore?

Are you OK with another developer taking over the plugin? If so, inform the
community in Discord (#plugin-dev) that the plugin is up for adoption. This will
allow an interested developer to take over.

Is there already a specific developer that wants to take over the plugin? If so,
let the mods know in Discord that they may submit PRs.

Do you wish to discontinue the plugin and block other developers from adopting
it? If so, let the mods know in Discord and provide your rationale. The requests
are evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

## What happens if I stop updating my plugin?

If your plugin has fallen behind the current API level for over three months,
other developers may adopt your plugin if they make a reasonable effort to reach
you. If they are unable to reach you, they may adopt the plugin and take over
development.

If your plugin has fallen behind the current API level for over six months,
other developers may adopt your plugin without your permission.

## How do I adopt an existing plugin?

You may adopt a plugin if you meet one of the following criteria:

- Consent of the current maintainer.
- The plugin has fallen behind the current API level for over three months. You
  have made reasonable efforts to reach the original developer.
- The plugin has fallen behind the current API level for over six months.

Simply inform the community in Discord (#plugin-dev) and submit a PR to add
yourself as an owner and update the repo url.
