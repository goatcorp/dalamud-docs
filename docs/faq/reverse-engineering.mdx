## How do I get started with reverse-engineering the game so that I can do things Dalamud doesn't expose?

Reverse-engineering isn't easy, and it's even more difficult when reversing a
large game like FFXIV. It's a large subject and hard to explore, but here are
some rough pointers.

Fundamentally, the game is running on your machine, which means it's executing
code constantly to run the game logic and to render the scene. In addition, it
is constantly talking to the game server, which is what allows you to interact
with other players and the world at large.

If you'd like to learn more about how the game communicates with the server,
your best bet is the
[Sapphire project](https://github.com/SapphireServer/Sapphire). The Dalamud
project generally strays away from interfering with client-server communication
for the reasons outlined in
[What am I allowed to do in my plugin?](#q-what-am-i-allowed-to-do-in-my-plugin),
but understanding the flow may help with other things.

Otherwise, you'll be reverse-engineering the game client, as that's what Dalamud
hooks into. The game binary you have is compiled machine code; the original
source code for the game is unavailable, which means you have to figure out what
it's doing without knowing any of the original context.

To do this, you'll need an interactive disassembler/decompiler to conduct
_static analysis_. The gold standard for this is
[IDA Pro](https://hex-rays.com/ida-pro/), but it is very expensive for hobbyists
and most people take an approach generally frowned upon by the Maelstrom. A
popular free alternative is [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/), which is very
powerful and extensible, if not a little clunky. There are other disassemblers,
but these are the two primarily used by the Dalamud community.

Once you have your disassembler ready, you'll need to disassemble the
`ffxiv_dx11.exe` file in the game's directory. After doing this, it is highly
recommended that you use
[the excellent script provided by FFXIVClientStructs](https://github.com/aers/FFXIVClientStructs/tree/main/ida);
this script will automatically populate your disassembler's database with
community findings for the current version, saving you a great deal of time.

After that, well... it's time for you to work on the puzzle. You'll want to find
resources for how to reverse-engineer things online; there are tutorials that
specifically look at reversing games, which may help you build up an intuition
for the thought process you'll need.

Another approach you can take is _dynamic analysis_. You can attach a debugger
to the game, like [x64dbg](https://x64dbg.com/) or
[Cheat Engine](https://www.cheatengine.org/), and use these to explore the
game's memory and execution at runtime (e.g. searching for a value and finding
what changes it in the code). Both approaches are valid, but you'll likely need
to use both to make headway as they can provide context for each other.

Reversing is a large and complex field, and it takes years to get proficient and
recognise patterns. Asking the Discord for help is encouraged, but be aware that
you have a long journey ahead of you regardless.

## How do I hook a game function?

Hooking a function refers to intercepting its execution, so that your code runs
in lieu of or as an extension to it. This could allow you to, for example,
detect when a certain action occurs in-game and change its behaviour.

Assuming that you've successfully found a function you'd like to hook through
reverse-engineering, Dalamud and EasyHook make hooking functions fairly easy.
You'll need the address of the function to hook; this can be retrieved from your
disassembler, or by getting a "signature" for the function, which is a unique
string of instructions that can be used to find the address.

Using signatures is preferred where possible as it improves the chances of your
plugin surviving a game update (as addresses always change, while signatures do
not). To get a signature, you'll need to look up how to do it with your
preferred disassembler. For IDA,
[Caraxi's fork of SigMaker-x64](https://github.com/Caraxi/SigMaker-x64) is
recommended.

If you have a signature, you will need to resolve it to an address in your code.
For a traditional string-of-instruction-bytes signature, you can use
[ScanText](https://goatcorp.github.io/Dalamud/api/Dalamud.Game.SigScanner.html#Dalamud_Game_SigScanner_ScanText_System_String_).
For other types of signatures, please look at the other methods for `SigScanner`
and choose an appropriate one.

After that:

- Import `Dalamud.Hooking`.
- Create a delegate type with the same type signature as the function you're
  hooking.
- Create a `Hook<YourDelegateType>` variable to represent the hook.
- Create a function in which your custom code will execute. It should match the
  type signature of the delegate.
- In your `Initialize` function:
- Get the address for the function (either as-is or through a signature).
- Initialize your `Hook` variable by calling its constructor with the address,
  delegate-ified version of your custom code function, and `this`.
- Enable the hook.
- In your `Dispose` function:
- Disable the hook.
- Dispose of the hook.

You should then be ready to go. An abbreviated example (only relevant portions
shown) of hooking the main `Render` function for the game follows:

```c#
using Dalamud.Hooking;
using Dalamud.Plugin;

namespace SamplePlugin
{
    public class Plugin : IDalamudPlugin
    {
        public string Name => "SamplePlugin";

        private DalamudPluginInterface pi;

        public delegate IntPtr RenderDelegate(IntPtr renderManager);
        private Hook<RenderDelegate> renderDelegateHook;

        public void Initialize(DalamudPluginInterface pluginInterface)
        {
            this.pi = pluginInterface;

            // Render::Manager::Render
            var Signature = "40 53 55 57 41 56 41 57 48 83 EC 60";
            var renderAddress = this.pi.TargetModuleScanner.ScanText(Signature);

            this.renderDelegateHook = new Hook<RenderDelegate>(renderAddress, this.RenderDetour);
            this.renderDelegateHook.Enable();
        }

        private unsafe IntPtr RenderDetour(IntPtr renderManager)
        {
            PluginLog.Information("Before render");
            var res = this.renderDelegateHook.Original(renderManager);
            PluginLog.Information("After render");

            return res;
        }

        public void Dispose()
        {
            this.renderDelegateHook.Disable();
            this.renderDelegateHook.Dispose();
            this.pi.Dispose();
        }
    }
}
```
