## What happens when there's an API version bump?

When there's an API version bump, your plugin will no longer be loaded by
Dalamud. To fix this, you'll need to update to the latest version of the API by
updating the JSON file for your plugin and repackaging your plugin for the
repository.

## How can I stay up to date with API changes?

The best place to stay up to date with upcoming API changes is to frequent the
[Discord server](https://goat.place/). Changes will be announced with notice so
that you can adapt your plugin as appropriate.

After submitting your first plugin to the repository, you will be given a Plugin
Developer role so that you will be pinged whenever breaking changes occur.

## How do I fix `Nothing inherits from IDalamudPlugin`?

This occurs because you have the dependencies for your plugin in the same folder
as the plugin (e.g. `Dalamud.dll` and such). This was supported prior to .NET 5,
but is no longer supported.

To fix this, open the `csproj` file and add `<Private>false</Private>` to each
of your `Reference`s like so:

```xml
<Reference Include="Dalamud">
    <HintPath>$(AppData)\XIVLauncher\addon\Hooks\dev\Dalamud.dll</HintPath>
    <Private>false</Private>
</Reference>
```

After doing this, clean out your output folder and rebuild. It will no longer
copy the dependencies, and your plugin should now be able to load correctly.

## What happens when the game is updated?

When the game is updated, it is likely that your plugin will stop working and/or
Dalamud will refuse to load it. To fix this, you'll need to:

- Wait for Dalamud to update to accommodate the new game version.
- Update your plugin to ensure it's using the latest API version and still works
  with the game. Ensure that any non-Dalamud interactions with the game (e.g.
  direct interop, etc) have been updated.
- Repackage and reupload your plugin.
