# Getting Started

```mdx-code-block
import TOCInline from '@theme/TOCInline';
import Construction from '@site/src/components/Construction';

<Construction />
<TOCInline toc={toc} />
```

## How do I get started?

The majority of the XIVLauncher and Dalamud ecosystem is written in C# for its
usability, convenience, and robustness. It is recommended that anything you work
on is also in C#, unless you're working on something with a significant amount
of interoperation with native code (in which C++/CLI may be useful) or you're
experimenting with other .NET languages.

To get started, you'll want to get the latest version of Visual Studio found
[here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/); the Community edition
will work fine. After doing so, you can clone any of the following projects and
get to work with their Visual Studio solutions. Alternatively, you may want to
use another IDE such as [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/).

### Dalamud Plugins

Plugins allow you to interact with the game and add features, modify
functionality, and do much more. We ask you to be respectful of
[our guidelines](#q-what-am-i-allowed-to-do-in-my-plugin) to ensure that your
plugin is approved into the primary repository, and to minimise the risk of
action by Square Enix. You can read more about this
[here](#q-why-do-you-discourage-certain-types-of-plugins).

We recommend that you start by cloning one of the following templates, and then
customising it to your requirements. While `SamplePlugin` is the most actively
maintained, the others are updated as required:

- [@goatcorp/SamplePlugin](https://github.com/goatcorp/SamplePlugin)
- [@karashiiro/DalamudPluginProjectTemplate](https://github.com/karashiiro/DalamudPluginProjectTemplate)
- [@lmcintyre/PluginTemplate](https://github.com/lmcintyre/PluginTemplate)

To distribute a plugin, it needs to be packaged correctly. This can be done
manually or [with DalamudPackager](https://github.com/goatcorp/DalamudPackager).

When your plugin is ready for testing/release, it should be PRed over to the
[DalamudPluginsD17](https://github.com/goatcorp/DalamudPluginsD17) repo.
**Please place testing plugins in the testing/live folder**.

### Dalamud

Dalamud is the core addon/plugin system. It is loaded by XIVLauncher into your
game, and is responsible for loading your plugins and providing them with a core
set of functionality.

The Dalamud source code
[can be found on GitHub](https://github.com/goatcorp/Dalamud).

Other assets required by Dalamud can be found
[in the DalamudAssets repository](https://github.com/goatcorp/DalamudAssets).

You can find the [Dalamud API documentation](api) on this site.

### XIVLauncher

XIVLauncher is a custom launcher for FFXIV that offers a number of benefits,
including faster launching, saved credentials, and automatically injecting
Dalamud into the game.

The XIVLauncher source code can be found
[on GitHub](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher).

## Where do I ask for help?

The best place to ask for help is the
[#dev channel](https://discord.gg/wwYXnzWYqY) of the Discord; we're a helpful
bunch and will do our best to answer your query as long as you explain what
you've tried and looked at so far.

## How do I hot-reload my plugin?

As of API 4/Dalamud 6, hot-reloading is part of Dalamud. To use it, go to
Dalamud Settings > Experimental > Dev Plugin Locations, and then add either the
folder that your plugin is in or the plugin itself. If you add a folder, Dalamud
will attempt to load all DLLs within the folder.

Your configuration should look something like this:

## How do I debug my plugin and/or the game?

To debug, you'll need to attach a debugger to the game. This will usually be
from your development environment, such as Visual Studio.

However, the game has antidebug protection on by default. To turn this off, use
the Dalamud dev menu (`/xldev`), then go to Dalamud > Enable AntiDebug; this
setting is persisted between launches, so you do not need to turn it on each
time.

Once you've done this, you can attach to the game with your debugger. In Visual
Studio, you can go to Debug > Attach to Process (Ctrl+Alt+P), and then select
the FF14 process. For the full debugging experience, make sure to change "Attach
to" to include both `Native code` and `Managed (.NET 4.x) code`; this will
ensure that the debugger will work for both the game and for Dalamud plugins.

This functionality is only supported for debugging your plugins. You will not
receive support if you use it for anything else.

[Detailed instructions are available here.](debug)

## How do I use FFXIVClientStructs in my own code?

[FFXIVClientStructs](https://github.com/aers/FFXIVClientStructs) is a communal
project to provide an interface to the game's classes, data, and more to C#
users and reverse engineers.

To use FFXIVClientStructs in your own code, you'll need to add a reference to
it. This can be done by opening the `csproj` for your plugin and adding the
reference with the other references:

```xml
    <Reference Include="FFXIVClientStructs">
      <HintPath>$(AppData)\XIVLauncher\addon\Hooks\dev\FFXIVClientStructs.dll</HintPath>
    </Reference>
```

or through right-clicking the project in VS, going to Add, and then adding an
Assembly Reference to the same path. Note that you will likely need to still
open the `csproj` after doing this to ensure that the path uses `$(AppData)` and
not the path specific to your system.

The version of FFXIVClientStructs included with Dalamud is updated with
reasonable frequency, and has several patches to ensure that backwards
compatibility with existing plugins is not broken. You can bundle your own
version if you'd like for the latest findings, but be aware that this may make
it difficult for you to maintain compatibility with new versions of the game
and/or Dalamud.
