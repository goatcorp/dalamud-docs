# What's New in Dalamud v15

:::warning[Not finalized]

This version is not finalized, and all details here are subject to change.

:::

Dalamud v15 is the current major version of Dalamud, and will release with Patch
7.4. This is a high-level overview of changes. You can see a code diff of all of
these changes
[here](https://github.com/goatcorp/Dalamud/compare/master...api15).

## Key Information

- **Branch:** `api15` ([view on GitHub](https://github.com/goatcorp/Dalamud/tree/api15))
- **Release Date:** TBA
- **API Level:** 15
- **.NET Version:** .NET 10.0.0

:::warning[Dalamud.NET.Sdk Migration]

If you haven't done so yet, we strongly recommend
[migrating your plugin project to Dalamud.NET.Sdk](/plugin-development/how-tos/v12-sdk-migration).

It includes the latest version of DalamudPackager, pinned to the current API
level, and will make it easier for us to introduce changes to how we distribute
SDK files in the future.

## Major Changes

### New Features

### Changes to existing features

## Minor Changes

### Distributed manifest must be accurate
Up until now, when Dalamud installed a plugin, the `InternalName.json` file inside the plugin zip archive would be overwritten with the manifest
from the repository. This is no longer the case to aid with consistency and a possible future repo schema change, but this also means that you must
ensure that your zip contains a manifest and that it is accurate.

## SDK & Packages

We have released new packages of the SDK and DalamudPackager for this Dalamud
API version.

- [Dalamud.NET.Sdk v14.0.1](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Dalamud.NET.Sdk/14.0.1)
  - To upgrade, change the header of your plugins' `.csproj` file:
    `<Project Sdk="Dalamud.NET.Sdk/14.0.1">`
- [DalamudPackager v14.0.1](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DalamudPackager/14.0.1)
  - You don't need to reference DalamudPackager manually if you use
    Dalamud.NET.Sdk, it is done for you.
