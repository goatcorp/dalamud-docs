# What's New in Dalamud v15

:::warning[Not finalized]

This version is not finalized, and all details here are subject to change.

:::

Dalamud v15 is the current major version of Dalamud, and will release with Patch
7.5. This is a high-level overview of changes. You can see a code diff of all of
these changes
[here](https://github.com/goatcorp/Dalamud/compare/master...api15).

## Key Information

- **Branch:** `api15`
  ([view on GitHub](https://github.com/goatcorp/Dalamud/tree/api15))
- **Release Date:** TBA
- **API Level:** 15
- **.NET Version:** .NET 10.0.0

:::warning[Dalamud.NET.Sdk Migration]

If you haven't done so yet, we strongly recommend
[migrating your plugin project to Dalamud.NET.Sdk](/plugin-development/how-tos/v12-sdk-migration).

It includes the latest version of DalamudPackager, pinned to the current API
level, and will make it easier for us to introduce changes to how we distribute
SDK files in the future.

## Major Changes

### New Features

### Changes to existing features

#### IChatGui

- The `XivChatType` value in all OnMessage events is now properly parsed.  
  Previously, it contained packed relation data, which is now exposed via new
  `sourceKind` and `targetKind` parameters. The enum can now be used with its
  intended values, which represent rows in the LogKind sheet.
  - Plugins relying on out-of-range XivChatType values (above 110) will need to
    update their logic.  
    The `LogMessage` event introduced in API 14 may be a suitable alternative.

## Minor Changes

### IClientState

- `ZoneInitEventArgs` was updated to use RowRefs. Additionally the arrays
  `ActiveFestivals` and `ActiveFestivalPhases` were merged into a single
  `IReadOnlyList<FestivalEntry> ActiveFestivals`.

### Distributed manifest must be accurate

Up until now, when Dalamud installed a plugin, the `InternalName.json` file
inside the plugin zip archive would be overwritten with the manifest from the
repository. This is no longer the case to aid with consistency and a possible
future repo schema change, but this also means that you must ensure that your
zip contains a manifest and that it is accurate.

## SDK & Packages

We have released new packages of the SDK and DalamudPackager for this Dalamud
API version.

- [Dalamud.NET.Sdk v14.0.2](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Dalamud.NET.Sdk/14.0.2)
  - To upgrade, change the header of your plugins' `.csproj` file:
    `<Project Sdk="Dalamud.NET.Sdk/14.0.2">`
- [DalamudPackager v14.0.2](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DalamudPackager/14.0.2)
  - You don't need to reference DalamudPackager manually if you use
    Dalamud.NET.Sdk, it is done for you.
