# What's New in Dalamud v9

Dalamud v9 is the next major version of Dalamud, to be released together with
Patch 6.5. This is a high-level overview of changes. You can see a code diff of
all of these changes
[here.](https://github.com/goatcorp/dalamud/compare/master...v9)

## Key Information

- **Branch:** `v9`
  ([view on GitHub](https://github.com/goatcorp/Dalamud/tree/v9))
- **Release Date:** Targeted to release alongside Patch 6.5 (estimated
  September/October 2023).
- **API Level:** 9
- **.NET Version:** .NET 7.0
  - .NET 8 is due for official release in November 2023. Due to release timing,
    we will be targeting .NET 7.0 for v9, and will upgrade to .NET 8 in a future
    release, when we can confirm that it is stable on all platforms (Windows,
    Wine, OS X).

## New Features

- The console (`/xllog`) has been redone, and now lets you create filters that
  can filter to specific plugins.
- Added a new plugin-specific logging class that you can receive as a service
  instance via the `IPluginLog` type.
  - Static functions in `PluginLog` have been deprecated, and we recommend that
    you move to the new service. They were slow and unreliable, due to having to
    look up the calling plugin via reflection, and wonâ€™t support new filtering
    features in the improved console.
  - We are planning to remove the static functions in a future API cycle.
- Extended `DtrBarEntry` to now allow for a tooltip, and an OnClick event, to
  add even more functionality to your DTR bar entries.
- Added `IAddonLifecycle` and `IAddonEventManager` services which simplify
  access to addons greatly.
- Added comprehensive new service to acquire ImGui textures from game
  icons/textures via `ITextureProvider`, detailed below.
- Added various new functions to manipulate colors for UI work in
  `Dalamud.Interface.ColorHelpers`.

## Major Changes

### General

- All services must be used via interfaces, their implementations are now
  private.
  - This allows us to create per-plugin implementations of services, which will
    be able to safely dispose of plugin-specific resources - something we have
    never been able to do before reliably - and opens up the possibility of
    creating mocks that allow for testing outside of the game.
  - We can also now build features that rely on detecting what plugin is using a
    service, like plugin-scoped logs and reliable command lists.
  - To migrate, you only have to change the type used to the interface
    equivalent in the `Dalamud.Plugin.Services` namespace (e.g. `DataManager` =>
    `IDataManager`)
- `IDataManager.ClientOpcodes` and `IDataManager.ServerOpcodes` have been
  removed. Dalamud systems that use opcodes directly will now use hooks instead.
  We recommend any plugin that has been using these opcodes to switch to hooks.

### UI and ImGui

- The `UiBuilder.OpenMainUi` event has been added, which you should subscribe to
  to open your plugin's "main interface", if applicable
  - This is shown as a separate, highlighted button in the plugin installer, in
    addition to the already existing `OpenConfigUi` button
- Texture- and Icon-related functions on DataManager have been removed and are
  now available in a new service, `ITextureProvider`.
  - API has been simplified in a major way and now properly supports
    high-resolution textures
  - Icons and textures are now only loaded once globally when requesting them
    using this service, reducing memory usage
  - Icons and textures are now automatically unloaded if not drawn for more than
    2 seconds, and will be reloaded transparently if they are accessed again by
    your plugin
  - An API that allows plugins to replace paths to tex files has been added.
    This means that you no longer manually have to implement this functionality
    to make your plugin compatible with e.g. UI mods.
  - ITextureProvider is designed for ImGui specific use cases. Plugins that need
    to work with raw tex files should implement their own logic.
- All Dalamud APIs that interact with textures now return `IDalamudTextureWrap`,
  and `IDalamudTextureWrap` no longer inherits from the `TextureWrap` type in
  ImGuiScene. This has been done to decouple the public API from ImGuiScene, and
  to remove the need for plugins to reference it.
  - To migrate, you merely need to switch the types used. The exposed API is
    exactly the same.
  - `IDalamudTextureWrap.Size` (`Vector2`) has been added, finally.
- IDisposable ImGui-helpers have been moved to the main Dalamud assembly and are
  now accessible via the `Dalamud.Interface.Utility` namespace
  - We recommend using these for **any new UI**, as they are much safer and
    reduce the chance of crashes caused by misbehaving UI code

### Hooking

- Obsolete constructors for `Hook<T>` and the static `Hook<T>.FromX()` functions
  have been removed.
  - Please use the equivalent functions in the `IGameInteropProvider` service
  - `IGameInteropProvider.HookFromSignature()` has been added
- `SignatureHelper.Initialize()` has been removed. Please use
  `IGameInteropProvider.InitializeFromAttributes()`.

## Minor Changes

- `Util.HttpClient` has been removed in favor of allowing plugins to manage
  their own HTTP lifecycles.
  - You can use `Dalamud.Networking.Http.HappyEyeballsCallback` as your
    `SocketsHttpHandler.ConnectCallback` to enable improved IPv6 connection
    handling to dual-stack servers.
- `SeStringManager` has been removed. Please use `SeStringBuilder` instead.
- `ChatHandlers` has been removed.
  - `ChatHandlers.IsAutoUpdateComplete` is now available as
    `DalamudPluginInterface.IsAutoUpdateComplete`
  - `ChatHandlers.MakeItalics()` can be accessed via `SeStringBuilder`
- `Util.CopyTo()` has been removed, as it has been added to the standard library
  as `Stream.CopyTo()`.
- `DalamudPluginInterface.PluginNames` and `PluginInternalNames` have been
  replaced in favor of `InstalledPlugins`, which provides more context.
- Obsolete/non-functional icons in `FontAwesomeIcon` have been removed.
- `DataManager.IsDataReady` has been removed, as it is always true when plugins
  are loaded.
- `SeStringBuilder.AddItemLink()` now correctly adds a full item link, instead
  of only adding an `ItemPayload`.
- `Util.IsLinux()` has been changed to `Util.IsWine()`. `Util.GetHostPlatform()`
  has been added to get the actual platform the game is running on - this relies
  on a special env var that may not be present on all environments Dalamud can
  run under yet.
- The Serilog property `SourceContext` is no longer used for Dalamud systems.
  Plugins implementing their own logging systems should write their plugin
  internal name to the `Dalamud.PluginName` property instead, otherwise,
  **filtering in the new console will not work**.
- `UIBuilder.GposeActive` has been moved to `IClientState.IsGPosing`, and is now
  more reliable/will only be true if the user is actually in GPose.
- `IDalamudPlugin.Name` has been removed. This has not been shown anywhere in
  more than 2 years.
- Dev-Plugins without a manifest are no longer supported. Please have a manifest
  or use DalamudPackager!
- Most `FlyTextKind` enum members have been renamed, see commit
  [here](https://github.com/goatcorp/Dalamud/commit/4989e2b69b8ce23dbe01b8a6786267e6a0ed6ea2).

## Errata

These changes have been made after the official stabilization.

- `SigScanner` was mistakenly made internal, making it impossible for plugins to
  create their own scanners
  - `SigScanner` was made public with the same API, and the internal service
    implementation was decoupled
