# Getting Started

Plugins allow you to interact with the game and add features, modify
functionality, and do much more. We ask you to be respectful of
[our guidelines](restrictions#what-am-i-allowed-to-do-in-my-plugin) to ensure
that your plugin is approved into the official plugin repository, and to
minimise the risk of action by Square Enix. You can read more about this
[here](restrictions#why-do-you-discourage-certain-types-of-plugins).

We recommend that you start by cloning the [`SamplePlugin`
repository][sample-plugin] and then customizing it to your specific
requirements. This plugin template contains many common settings as well as
frequently-used sample code to help bootstrap plugin creation.

To distribute a plugin, it needs to be packaged correctly. This can be done
manually or [with DalamudPackager](https://github.com/goatcorp/DalamudPackager).

When your plugin is ready for testing/release, you should make a pull request to
the [DalamudPluginsD17](https://github.com/goatcorp/DalamudPluginsD17) repo.
**Please place testing plugins in the testing/live folder**.
